# Discord-Bot

Discord Bot made using Discord.js and node.js

Dicord.js Documentation: https://discord.js.org/

Dicord.js Guide: https://discordjs.guide/

And a helpful youtube tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV4iltEdBs4&list=PLaxxQQak6D_fxb9_-YsmRwxfw5PH9xALe
<br> This tutorial actually helped me with how to host the bot on Heroku.
<br> Most of the stuffs you can implement by just seeing the guide and dicord.js documentation.

<br>
The bot that I have build here is basically a customized one which helps me to play the Among Us game with my friends.
